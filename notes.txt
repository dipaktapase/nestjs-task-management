- We import service in controller's constructor
- Injectable makes it singletone shared across the whole application
- private in constructor - taskService parameter is a property of a TaskController

- taskService owns the business logic
- controller is a entry point communicate with service and return the result
- adding private keyword in service means only this service has access to it not controller
